        <h1>At an early age developing Trinton's muscles was very important in giving him an advantage over the other kids his age.</h1>
        

        <p>Trinton and his father would begin arm strenthening to give im enough power to make the throw from home to second base with no bounce as his position as catcher.</p>

        <p>As he began to throw more accurate and powerful,his coaches took notice of his arm strengh and accuracy then changed his position to pitching.</p>
        <p>He continues his muscle training to this day,conditioning his body for Major league competition.
        </p>
        <p>Trintons family felt it was important to have training equipment at home to train as much as possible,and to develop his muscles gradually and savely.</p>
